## Storybook

Storybook for React Native is configured out-of-the-box in DEV builds only (local device or simulator). You can access it in the Side Menu by clicking on "Storybook".

### Stories

Sample "stories" are available for the generated components. They allow you to preview the components in various states, dependant on the props passed to them.

- [`search-bar.story.js`](https://github.com/ruddell/ignite-jhipster/blob/53d1d3e9cd5bd4fbba5ca8b20d7334a9b7ad24f4/boilerplate/app/shared/components/search-bar/search-bar.story.js)
- [`alert-message.story.js`](https://github.com/ruddell/ignite-jhipster/blob/main/boilerplate/app/shared/components/alert-message/alert-message.story.js)

Use fixtures (JSON files containing sample data) to write stories for your own components.

For more information on configuration and writing stories for Storybook, check the [official Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react-native/).
