## :no_entry_sign: Standard Compliant

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
This project adheres to Standard.  Our CI enforces this, so we suggest you enable linting to keep your project compliant during development.

**To Lint on Commit**

This is implemented using [husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky). There is no additional setup needed.

**Bypass Lint**

If you have to bypass lint for a special commit that you will come back and clean (pushing something to a branch etc.) then you can bypass git hooks with adding `--no-verify` to your commit command.

**Understanding Linting Errors**

The linting rules are from JS Standard and React-Standard.  [Regular JS errors can be found with descriptions here](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/), while [React errors and descriptions can be found here](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react).
